            How do we know if we have enough tests for a method or a class?
            That's when a code coverage tool comes into the picture. A code coverage tool, scans your code and tells you what parts of your code are not tested.
            
            Code coverage tools are:
            - Visual Studio Enterprise Edition
            - ReSharper Ultimate
