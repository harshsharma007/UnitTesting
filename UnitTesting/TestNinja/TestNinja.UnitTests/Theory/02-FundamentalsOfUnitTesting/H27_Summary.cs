            Characteristics of good unit test is that they should be small, have a single responsibility and no logic.
            
            They should not be too generic or too specific and they should be isolated, meaning each test should run using a clean, fresh state as if it's the only test 
            in the world.
            
            You should test the outcome of a function irrespective of how it's implemented and that you should not test language features or third party code.
            
            You learned how to use the SetUp method to do all the initialization before your test methods and how to write parameterized tests.
            
            Finally, you learned two ways to write reliable and trustworthy tests. You either use TDD or make a small change to a production code that should make the 
            test fail. If the test still passes that means that test is not a trustworthy test that you can rely upon.
