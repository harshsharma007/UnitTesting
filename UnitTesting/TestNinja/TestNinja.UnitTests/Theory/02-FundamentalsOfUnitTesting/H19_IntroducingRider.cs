            Rider is a cross platform IDE built by Jet Brains, the same company that has created ReSharper. It's super fast, it's light weight and it's my preferred
            IDE. If you want to use Visual Studio, that's perfectly fine but let me show you one of my favorite features in Rider, that you can also get with ReSharper,
            inside Visual Studio.
            
            With Rider and with ReSharper, we can run a single test. An icon would appear in front of the method and you just have to click the icon and an option will
            appear to run the method. This feature is not available in Visual Studio and that's very inefficient, because in a large, real world application, you
            might have hundreds or thousands of tests.
            
            Sometimes, you're working on a particular test, you're making changes and you want to run only that test. You don't want to run all the tests and wait
            every time you are making a simple change, in a single test method.
            
            In Rider, we can run all the tests inside the ReservationTests class, you can see an icon in front of the class to run all the tests inside the class. The
            shortcut to this is Ctrl+T Ctrl+R.
