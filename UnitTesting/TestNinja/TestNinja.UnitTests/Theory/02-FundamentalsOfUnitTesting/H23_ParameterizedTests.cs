            Instead of creating multiple test methods, we can create one test method that may expect some parameters along with expected parameter. And we can pass the 
            data through TestCase attribute. This is known as Parameterized Tests. This is possible only in NUnit and xUnit.
            
            But this is not possible in MS Test, in MS Test you have to create an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file, put it in your test project and then reference the 
            file and the spreadsheet. Basically, it's too complex.
