            When it comes to automated testing, there are two schools of thought. On one side of the spectrum, we have this super smart developer who thinks, he's an 
            amazing coder, he writes bug free code and he doesn't need to write tests for his code.
            
            In fact, he thinks writing automated tests is a waste of time because they slow you down. He argues that they delay your delivery and every time you change 
            your application code, you have to deal with a bunch of broken tests and all this is costly.
            
            On the other side of the spectrum, we have this highly opinionated developer who thinks you're not a developer if you don't write tests. So who's right?
            
            Neither of them, we can ignore both of them and take the middle ground. In every application, it is absolutely essential to have a level of automated testing. 
            Yes, it is true that writing automated tests take time. These tests are not automatically generated.
            
            You need to write them by hand! And you need to keep them in good shape and maintain them just like your application code. However, if you don't spend this 
            time writing these tests, then you're likely to spend more time fixing the bugs after deploying your application.
            
            Multiple studies have shown that the later we catch bugs, the more costly it gets to fix them. So, when you have a suite of automated tests, you can catch 
            these bugs earlier in the software developement lifecycle, specifically when you're writing the code.
            
            Uncle Bob or Robert C Martin, has a metaphor and compares unit testing to double entry book keeping. Every transaction is entered twice; once in the credit 
            books, and once in the debit books. The two entries participate in very different calculations but eventually result in a final result of zero.
            
            Of course, the effort is double but accountants believe this practice is worth the effort because it reduces the chances for errors. Uncle Bob argues that 
            writing tests is exactly like double entry book keeping!
            
            For every piece of logic we have in our application code, somewhere we have a test that verifies that logic is implemented properly. Some people complain 
            that they don't have time to write tests!
            
            Here's a question for you. Imagine you are a pilot. Would you fly your passengers if you're behind the schedule? Of course not! If you're a surgeon, would 
            you rush to surgery just to make sure you finish the operation according to the schedule? Of course not!
            
            If a pilot can delay a flight, you can delay your delivery schedule and focus on delivering quality software with less defects. Your boss or client may think 
            they're losing money if you don't release this new shiny feature in time, but when you rush the delivery, and don't write your tests, you end up writing bad 
            code with many bugs and then you have to spend more time and money fixing those bugs.
            
            So, you need to explain this to your boss or client who is rushing you to delivery! So, the reality is that building software is costly. You either choose to 
            pay that cost upfront by writing tests or pay a far greater cost after releasing your software.
